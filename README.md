# rs-lcr

Unofficial API and utilities for Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR) data in Rust. 

The [official Church LCR website](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) is where leaders and clerks spend a lot of time. The Church doesn't offer an API, so I thought I'd expose one. 
* A Python package to do similar things exists [here](https://github.com/philipbl/LCR-API) and I've used it for a few projects, but the Church keeps changing the login flow so it's constantly broken. This project uses headless Chrome to login so I'm hoping it will be more stable, and easier to fix if things do change.

* Current supported:
  - [x] Member list
  - [x] Members moved in
  - [x] Members moved out
  - [x] Member profile

## Usage
- Use the provided command-line interface:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ephraimkunz/rs-lcr.git`.
2. In the root of the repo, run `cargo run` which will print a help menu of possible options. You'll need to provide 3 environment variables: `LCR_USERNAME`, `LCR_PASSWORD`, `LCR_UNIT`. These correspond to your LDS username, password, and unit number. Your unit number can be found in parenthesis after the name of the ward in the LCR homepage.

- Use as a library:
1. Add `lcr = { git = "https://github.com/ephraimkunz/rs-lcr" }` to your Cargo.toml under the dependencies section.
2. You can run `cargo doc --open` in your project after doing so to get autogenerated documentation.
